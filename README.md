**Image Processing Fundamentals**

1. Image acquisition and representation
2. Image enhancement techniques (noise reduction, contrast adjustment, sharpening)
3. Image restoration
4. Geometric transformations (scaling, rotation, translation, affine transformations)
5. Image segmentation (thresholding, edge detection, region-based segmentation)

**Feature Extraction and Description**

1. Interest point detection (Harris corner detector, SIFT, SURF)
2. Feature descriptors (HOG, SIFT, SURF)
3. Feature matching and comparison
   
**Image Classification**
